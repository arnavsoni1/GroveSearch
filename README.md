# GroveSearch

As we all know, Grover's algorithm is used for searchng in untructured databases, or similar problems. Theoretically, it is used to find solutions to an equation f(x) = 1 for a boolean function f(x). So, technically - if the quantum hardware meets the demand, Grover's algorithm could be a step-up from the classical algorithms used to solve exhaustive search problems. One such problem is the Steiner tree problem. 

GroveSearch is a project that solves (or atleast attempts to solve) the Steiner tree problem using the Grover's Algorithm by implementing it in Qiskit.
